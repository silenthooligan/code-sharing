> **A collection of reverse engineering tools, automation scripts, and digital experiments.**

Welcome to my digital workbench. This repository is a home for code that solves interesting problems, breaks through "impossible" barriers, or just makes life a little bit easier. From reverse-engineering obscure file formats to automating mundane tasks, this is where the magic happens.

## 💡 Philosophy

Code should be:
1.  **Useful**: Solves a real problem.
2.  **Robust**: Handles edge cases and weird errors gracefully.
3.  **Creative**: Finds a way when the front door is locked.
