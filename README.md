🧠 The Code Vault
Ideas Status License

A collection of reverse engineering tools, automation scripts, and digital experiments.

Welcome to my digital workbench. This repository is a home for code that solves interesting problems, breaks through "impossible" barriers, or just makes life a little bit easier. From reverse-engineering obscure file formats to automating mundane tasks, this is where the magic happens.

🌟 Featured Projects
📖 FlipHTML5 Liberator
Break through the "Protected" wall. A robust tool designed to decrypt and download FlipHTML5 books, even those protected by complex WebAssembly (WASM) encryption and nested obfuscation.

Tech Stack: Python, Node.js, WASM Reverse Engineering.
Key Feature: Hybrid decoding architecture that patches Emscripten binaries on the fly.
📂 Repository Structure
The vault is organized by project. Each folder is a self-contained world with its own documentation and requirements.

Project	Description	Status
fliphtml5-liberator	Universal downloader for protected FlipHTML5 books.	✅ Stable
(More coming soon)	Watch this space for new experiments.	🚧 Planned
💡 Philosophy
Code should be:

Useful: Solves a real problem.
Robust: Handles edge cases and weird errors gracefully.
Creative: Finds a way when the front door is locked.
