📖 FlipHTML5 Liberator
Version License Python PRs Welcome

The Universal FlipHTML5 Downloader. Break through "Protected" books, decode WASM encryption, and generate high-quality PDFs.

🚀 Why This Tool?
Typical downloaders fail when they encounter FlipHTML5's "Protected" mode or newer "Encrypted Config" books. These books hide their page structure inside obfuscated code or encrypted blobs that require a specific WebAssembly (WASM) binary to decode.

FlipHTML5 Liberator uses a Hybrid Decoder Architecture to bypass these restrictions. It runs a local Node.js environment patched with the original 
deString.js
 and 
deString.wasm
 binaries to essentially "trick" the configuration into revealing itself.

✨ Features
🔓 Decrypts "Protected" Books: Handles books that lock down the UI and obscure source files.
🧠 WASM-Based Decoding: seamless integration with the original 
deString.wasm
 binary for 100% accurate decryption.
🕸️ Nested Encryption Handling: Detects and recursively decodes page lists hidden inside double-encrypted strings.
🔗 Hashed Path Resolution: Solves the puzzle of non-sequential, hashed image filenames (e.g., afbd9e...webp).
🖼️ High-Fidelity Output: Downloads the highest resolution (/files/large/) images available.
📄 PDF Generation: Automatically combines downloaded pages into a single book.pdf.
🛠️ Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+: Download Python
Node.js: Download Node.js (Required for the decryption engine)
WASM Binaries: You will need to "borrow" 
deString.js
 and 
deString.wasm
 from the target book (instructions below).
Getting Started
Clone the Repo (or download the scripts):

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fliphtml5-liberator.git
cd fliphtml5-liberator
Install Python Dependencies:

pip install httpx img2pdf Pillow
📖 Usage
1. Acquire the Keys 🔑
To decode the book, you need the "key" (the WASM files).

Open the target FlipHTML5 book in your web browser.
Open Developer Tools (F12 or Right Click -> Inspect).
Go to the Network tab.
Refresh the page.
Filter for deString.
Right-click and Download/Save both 
deString.js
 and 
deString.wasm
.
Place them in the root folder of this project.
2. Run the Liberator ⚡
Run the python script with the URL of the book you want to download.

python downloader.py https://online.fliphtml5.com/ousx/stby
What happens next:

The script fetches the obfuscated 
config.js
 from the server.
It launches 
fliphtml5_decoder.js
 in a subprocess.
The Node.js script patches the deString loader, injects polyfills, and runs the WASM decryption.
The decrypted JSON is piped back to Python.
Images are downloaded concurrently.
book.pdf is generated!
🧐 How It Works (The Technical Part)
This tool solves the "black box" problem of WASM obfuscation by implementing a Host Environment Polyfill.

Emscripten Patching: The original 
deString.js
 is generated by Emscripten and relies on browser-specific globals (window, Module.onRuntimeInitialized). We patch these out regex-style to run in a headless Node.js environment.
Memory Management: We manually implement 
stringToUTF8
 and 
UTF8ToString
 to bridge the gap between JavaScript strings and the WASM heap, as the original exports are often stripped or mangled.
Recursive Decryption: Some books use layers of encryption. The script detects if the decoded output contains another encrypted block (starting with signature v...) and recursively passes it back through the WASM decoder.
